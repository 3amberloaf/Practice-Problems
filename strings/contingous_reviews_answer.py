# Suppose a company has marked n strings that are prohibited in reviews. They assign a score to each review that denotes how well it follows the 
# guidlines. The score of a review is defined as the longest contingous substring of the review which does not contain anty string among the list of n 
# prohibited strings. A string contains a prohibited word if it has a contingous substring that matches a word from the prohibited list.
